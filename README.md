# Notes and solutions for the course Process Dynamics and Control in Python

The notes and solutions that I created when following the course [Process Dynamics and Control in Python](http://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php).

This course has its own solutions, which I used to asses the correctness of mine. My additions, to what is already available in the page of the couse, are:

- Sometimes, details when simplifying the equations step by step.
- The use of `solve_ivp` from Scipy instead of `odeint` to solve numerically the differential equations.
- My own code style.
